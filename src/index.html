      <p class="about__subheading paragraph-l">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show
        that only
        20% of them will find a
        family. The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly
        loved.</p>
      <p class="about__subheading paragraph-l">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get
        sick, feel
        comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various
        skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become
        attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
